# FAIR Privacy

**Primary Focus Area:** Privacy Risk Assessment

**Brief Description:** FAIR Privacy is a quantitative privacy risk framework based on FAIR (Factors Analysis in Information Risk). FAIR Privacy examines personal privacy risks (to individuals), not organizational risks. Included in this tool is a PowerPoint deck illustrating the components of FAIR Privacy and an example based on the US Census. In addition, an Excel spreadsheet provides a powerful risk calculator using Monte Carlo simulation. 

**Additional Notes:** 
Full details on the FAIR Privacy can be found in chapters 7 & 8 of the book Strategic Privacy by Design by R. Jason Cronk (IAPP 2018). Some additional resources are provided in the PowerPoint deck. 

Feedback and suggestions for improvement on both the framework and the included calculator are welcome. Additionally, analysis of the spreadsheet by a statistician is most welcome.
