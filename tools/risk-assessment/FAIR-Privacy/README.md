# FAIR Privacy

**Primary Focus Area:** Privacy Risk Assessment

**Brief Description:** FAIR Privacy is a quantitative privacy risk framework based on FAIR (Factors Analysis in Information Risk). FAIR Privacy examines personal privacy risks (to individuals), not organizational risks. Included in this tool is a PowerPoint deck illustrating the components of FAIR Privacy and an example based on the US Census. In addition, an Excel spreadsheet provides a powerful risk calculator using Monte Carlo simulation. 

**Additional Notes:** 
Feedback and suggestions for improvement on both the framework and the included calculator are welcome. Additionally, analysis of the spreadsheet by a statistician is most welcome.
